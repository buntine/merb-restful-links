 merb-restful-links 0.0.1
=================================

By Andrew Buntine

A plugin for Merb that allows you to supply a ":method" option to the link_to method. It accepts :put and :delete and will work in the same fashion as Rails. That is, on the onclick event, a temporary form will be constructed (using JavaScpript) with a hidden field named "_method". The form is automatically submitted so the user experience will not change.

For example:

  link_to "Delete", url(:post, 1), :method => :delete

Or:

  link_to "Save changes", url(:post, 1), :method => :put
